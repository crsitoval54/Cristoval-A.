Hi Im Cristoval Im a certified BI data analyst
I have spent the last 5 months working with data and discovering how to make data driven disicion. By making graphs and charts with the data it helped to make a visuals that help with making the data visualy apealing. During the proccess of gettign certified I had to mentaly prpare myself for new thinsgs to learn that could be hard at first but convincing myself I could do it helped with getting me through the program. I would like to participate in outsourceing projects to sharpen my skills that I have learned from Triple Ten. The skills I learned are SQL, cleaning data and making reports base off of data made or cleaned and explaining the relivence of charts and how it helps to solve the problem. They also showed me how to make charts to help visualize my findings to give a clean picture of what the data is showing. They also tought me the different metrics that can be used to find information about profit, revenue, and retention rate of a business.
Fun facts about me:
- Im self motivated
- always eagered to learn new skills/ sharpen my skills
- used to working independently
- enjoy working in groups
